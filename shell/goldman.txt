New York, NY, United States (4E) – Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is planning to cut over 5 percent of its fixed-income salesmen and traders in thee first quarter of this year as it faces declining revenue, according to a source familiar with the matter.

The New York-based investment bank will decide about the move after its evaluation of client activity during the period, the source said, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are not yet public.

The company may eventually reduce those operations further than its annual effort to cut around 5 percent of workforce to allow hiring of new employees, or it could shrink the business by no longer replacing those who were let go, the source said. T

he bank plans to cut to reduce as many as much as 10 percent of the division’s salesmen and traders, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal earlier Wednesday.

The move wouldn’t impact over 250 people, WSJ said, citing unidentified sources with knowledge of the matter.
